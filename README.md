# Artificial Intelligence Use Case for Credit Scoring & Risk Assessment in Fintech Firms

## Problem Statement

A Fintech company wants to leverage AI to analyze a wide range of data points beyond credit bureau information. This includes factors such as income, employment history, debt-to-income ratio, and loan purpose data to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers more comprehensively. The AI-powered credit scoring system enables real-time decisions, allowing loan applicants to receive instant approvals or rejections based on their risk profile. This streamlined process enhances the customer experience and reduces the time and effort required for loan underwriting.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to automate the credit scoring process using AI and machine learning techniques. The AI model will reduce manual intervention, ensure accurate and unbiased credit evaluations, and enhance the overall customer experience by providing real-time decisioning for loan applications. Additionally, the system aims to promote transparency and fairness in lending decisions.

## Scope

This project involves designing, developing, and deploying an AI-powered credit scoring system for Fintech firms. The primary focus is on automating the decision-making process in real-time and providing instant feedback on loan applications. Key objectives include:

- **Automate the auto-decision process** to minimize or eliminate the need for manual intervention.
- **Encourage fairer lending practices** by using transparent AI models.
- **Enhance customer experience** through instant decisioning.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Integration

- **Data Source**: The primary dataset is sourced from Kaggle.
- **Data Ingestion/Pipeline**: A data ingestion pipeline is designed to collect, clean, and preprocess the data, ensuring the model has high-quality inputs.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalize the data, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.

### 3. Model Development

- **Model Selection**: Algorithms like logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting are evaluated.
- **Training and Validation**: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure model robustness. Model performance is assessed using appropriate metrics.



### 4. Model Evaluation and Validation
Evaluate models using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and others to ensure accurate predictions.

### 5. Model Deployment
- **API Development**: Flask or FastAPI is used to develop real-time APIs for decision-making.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring for tracking model performance and logging predictions.
- **Dockerization**: Two Docker files are created (one for the frontend and one for the backend), containerizing the entire ML application.
- **Cloud Deployment**: The AI-powered credit-scoring application is deployed on AWS ECS.

### 6. Frontend

The frontend for the Credit AI system is developed using **React.js**. This interface allows users to submit loan applications and instantly view decisions powered by the AI model.

### 7. Docker Integration

Two Docker containers were created:
- **Frontend Container**: Containerizes the React.js application.
- **Backend Container**: Containerizes the machine learning model and API.

Both containers were pushed to Docker Hub and later deployed using Amazon ECS.
